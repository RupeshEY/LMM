/**
 *  This <b>class</b> controls which Contact relationships are included from the Address Book. By default, no relationships
 *  are included. Care should be taken when including relationships here, particularly with zero-or-more relationships.
 *  Since such relationships can grow in an unbounded way, there is the potential to pull down many Contacts from the
 *  Address Book.
 *
 *  Generally, those Contact relationships included from the Address Book are those that are reflected on the
 *  Contact "Basics" detail screen in the UI. So, it usually makes sense for the relationships configured here to match
 *  those that are explicitly shown on the main Contact UI.
 *
 *  Customers may edit the init() method below.  Add includeRelationship() and excludeRelationship()
 *  calls to add or remove relationships for a Contact subtype.  See ths GosuDoc for includeRelationship
 *  and excludeRelationship in RelationshipSyncConfigBase
