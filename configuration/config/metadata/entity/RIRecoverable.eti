  <fulldescription><![CDATA[
    A subtype of <code>RITransaction</code> that indicates an Amount of Payments attributable to a particular RIAgreement.
    Money has been paid out, so the reinsurer behind the RIAgreement is obligated to
    reimburse us for this amount according to the RI treaty.
    Like both types of RITransactions, RIRecoverables behave similar to Reserve transactions as entities: they are immutable,
    and so multiple positive or negative transactions are created to adjust the total on a particular RICoding.
    To get the Total RI Recoverables and other RI financials calculations,
    use the <code>FinancialsCalculationUtil</code> class.
