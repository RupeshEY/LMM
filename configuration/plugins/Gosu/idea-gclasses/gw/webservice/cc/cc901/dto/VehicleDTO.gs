/**
 * <p style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px">This Data Transfer Object ("DTO") class is used to generate a WSDL to serialize and deserialize information across the network. Any change to the public properties of this DTO class will change the WSDL, thus breaking any existing clients. So once the corresponding WSDL is in use this DTO should only be changed with extreme caution, as it will require existing clients to be rebuilt and redeployed.<br/><br/>
 * A(n) {@link VehicleDTO} is a DTO that represents an instance of {@link Vehicle} for use by certain WS-I Web Services in the base product. This file is composed of basic getters and setters, plus members that make it easier for server-side code to work with DTOs, like virtual getters that query for entities by PublicID, and methods to copy fields to or from an instance of {@link Vehicle}.
 * <p>None of these methods constrain how an instance of VehicleDTO is created, initialized or used (beyond the normal Gosu type checking): this is consistent with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object">DTO Design Pattern</a>, which states that "DTOs are simple objects that should not contain any business logic that would require testing". Validation logic that considers whether a DTO field can have a <i>particular</i> value (based on things like effective dates, jurisdictions, line of business, user permissions, the values of other fields, etc.) should not be handled here, but rather by the API that manipulates the VehicleDTO.
 * <p>Please read the documentation in the accelerator before reusing this class in any additional WS-I Web Services.</p>
 * <p>Fields are mapped according to the following rules:
 * <ul><li>Primitive values are copied directly</li><li>Typekey fields are copied directly (the WS-I layer translates them to/from WS-I enums)</li><li>Foreign keys fields are represented by the target object's PublicID</li><li>Arraykey fields are represented by an array of the PublicIDs of the elements in the array</li></ul></p>
 * <p>The specific mappings for {@link VehicleDTO} are as follows:
 * <table border="1"><tr><th>Field</th><th>Maps to</th></tr><tr><td>CreateTime</td><td>Vehicle.CreateTime</td></tr><tr><td>CreateUserPublicID</td><td>Vehicle.CreateUser.PublicID</td></tr><tr><td>LicensePlate</td><td>Vehicle.LicensePlate</td></tr><tr><td>Make</td><td>Vehicle.Make</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturer</td><td>Vehicle.Manufacturer</td></tr><tr><td>Model</td><td>Vehicle.Model</td></tr><tr><td>PublicID</td><td>Vehicle.PublicID</td></tr><tr><td>State</td><td>Vehicle.State</td></tr><tr><td>UpdateTime</td><td>Vehicle.UpdateTime</td></tr><tr><td>UpdateUserPublicID</td><td>Vehicle.UpdateUser.PublicID</td></tr><tr><td>Vin</td><td>Vehicle.Vin</td></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Vehicle.Year</td></tr></table></p>
