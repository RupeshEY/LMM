  <!--
    Configuration controlling behavior of syncing from Address Book. Use this file to specify which exportable
    properties are to be ignored when syncing. By default, all exportable properties are synced. Properties that exist
    in this application's definition of Contact but not in the Address Book should be specified here.

    This file also controls which Contact relationships are included from the Address Book. By default, no relationships
    are included. Care should be taken when including relationships here, particularly with zero-or-more relationships.
    Since such relationships can grow in an unbounded way, there is the potential to pull down many Contacts from the
    Address Book.

    Generally, those Contact relationships included from the Address Book are those that are reflected on the
    Contact "Basics" detail screen in the UI. So, it usually makes sense for the relationships configured here to match
    those that are explicitly shown on the main Contact UI.

    Logging category: Application.AddressBook.Config
    Deprecated since 8.0 Use ContactMapper and RelationshipSyncConfig to define ignored properties and syncable relationships
