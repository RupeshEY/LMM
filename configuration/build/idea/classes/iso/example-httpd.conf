# This is an example of how the Apache httpd.conf file might be set up if you
# use Apache as a proxy between ClaimCenter and ISO ClaimSearch. For more
# details see the ClaimCenter Integration guide, in particular the section
# "Detailed ISO Proxy Setup Using Apache HTTP Server"

# Global server configuration settings
# the proxy listens for Message 1 on $DMZProxyPortA
Listen $DMZProxyPortA

# The proxy listens for Message 2 & 3 on $DMZProxyPortB
Listen $DMZProxyPortB

#Disable forward proxying for security purposes
ProxyRequests Off 

#Virtual Host configuration: Two virtual hosts are configured to
#->Reverse proxy message from ClaimCenter to ISO (message 1)
#->Reverse proxy messages 2 & 3 from ISO to ClaimCenter (messages 2&3)
# ClaimCenter sends message 1 to the proxy on URL #1
