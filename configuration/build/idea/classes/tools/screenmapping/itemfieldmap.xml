    You can put mappings here that hardcode field references for items.  You can match on name, value, or both.
    If both a name and value are specified, it will attempt to match on both.  If only name is specified,
    any items with that name will be mapped to the given field, whereas if only a value is specifed, for
    NVVItemMap elements any item with that as either the value or display value field will be mapped,
    whereas for LVItemMap elements any column with that as the value will be mapped to the given DB field.
