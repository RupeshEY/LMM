  <fulldescription><![CDATA[<p>ValidationResult is used to read and write results of an object's validation (e.g. validation via rules, or field level validation).</p>
      <p>ValidationResult stores both entity level errors (general errors not associated with a particular field) and field level errors (errors associated with a particular field on an entity).</p>
      <p>A FieldValidation object can store the bad value which triggered the error (e.g. a mangled loss date that was imported with the claim) and may also suggests possible correct values,
      either as a list of objects or foreign keys (if the field is a foreign key, e.g. picking from a set of users with the last name "Shaw" if the imported ClaimDef only identifies "Shaw" as the owner).
      See FieldValidation to learn what information may be captured with an invalid field.</p>
