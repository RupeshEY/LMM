   * <p/>
   * It is generally desirable for Assignment rule writers to be able to re-use a single set of, say, Claim Assignment rules
   * for both primary and secondary assignments. This method allows rules to be written in the form of
   * <code>Claim.CurrentAssignment.assignXXX()</code> rather than <code>Claim.assignXXX()</code>. If the primary
   * assignment is being performed, then getCurrentAssignment() will return the entity itself (in this case, the Claim).
   * If a secondary assignment is being performed, then getCurrentAssignment() will return the UserRoleAssignment which
   * is current being operated upon.
   * <p/>
   * Obviously, if an entity does not support secondary assignment (i.e. does not implement the UserRoleOwner interface),
   * then rules do not need to use this method. Secondary assignments done outside of the Assignment Rules can simplay
   * call the assignXXX methods directly on the UserRoleAssignment entity themselves, and therefore also do not require
   * this method.
